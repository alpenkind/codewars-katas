//TASK 1
//Descending Order
/*Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

Examples:
Input: 42145 Output: 54421

Input: 145263 Output: 654321

Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321  */

//Task 2
// Cat Years & Dog Years

I have a cat and a dog.


I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.


Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]


NOTES:


humanYears >= 1
humanYears are whole numbers only
Cat Years
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that

// Twice as old

current father's age (years)
current age of his son (years)

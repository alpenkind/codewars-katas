//Descending Order
/*Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

Input: 42145 Output: 54421

Input: 145263 Output: 654321

Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321  */
